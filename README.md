# my dotfiles

this repo contains my configuration files, used with [arch
linux](https://archlinux.org/), [void linux](https://voidlinux.org/), and
[freebsd](https://www.freebsd.org/)

I use [yadm](https://yadm.io/) to manage my dotfiles in this repository

to use these dotfiles as your own, simply install yadm and run:

```
yadm clone https://github.com/robstumborg/dotfiles
```

I wouldn't recommend doing this. I think it makes more sense to take a look at
configs and pick out pieces you'd like to adopt in your own workstation
environment
